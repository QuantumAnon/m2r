## Using Git

Git is a version control system that allows many people to edit a project
simultaneously.
One advantage of using git is that it is device independent and will run on any 
modern operating system.
Another is that it allows files to be edited offline and saved to a repository
at a later time.

This is a short guide on how to get git set up for this project, as well as how
to save your changes and send them back to the repository.
To begin with you'll want to download a GUI git client from
[this](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) list.
I'd personally recommend gitkraken, which is free for our use-case.

Once you've got a git client installed, you'll need to create a GitHub account.
This is so I can grant you access to the repository where all the files are stored.
You can do that [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).
Again, for our purposes you only need a free account.
Once you've made an account, let me know your username and I'll grant you access.
You might need to log into [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) once for
me to add you.

If you're using gitkraken, you should be able to log into GitHub/GitLab and from
the program and it should display a list of *remote* repositories.
Among these, there will be this repository and you should be able to download it.
