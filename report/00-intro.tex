Much of algebra is concerned with substructures of algebraic objects, such as
subgroups, ideals, subspaces, etc.
Almost all of these objects have some inherent structure or 'rules' from which
the existence of these sub-objects can be inferred.
Ramsey theory aims to find conditions for the existence of substructures when
the superstructure has very few rules.
We aim to instil an appreciation of the subject in the reader and show how it may
be applied to other areas of mathematics.

% The condition is often a question of quantity, i.e. a substructure will exist
% in every large enough object.
