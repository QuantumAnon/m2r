\subsection{Ramsey's Theorem}
\label{sec:1.1}

The idea of finding regular substructure from chaotic structure is immediately
applicable to graphs.
The statement in the introduction - ``Given 6 people, either 3 mutually know each
other, or 3 do not" - can be rephrased in a graph theoretic sense.
We identify a person with a vertex of the graph, and a relation between them as
an edge.
A relation between two people can have  two states: either the two know each other,
or they have never met.
We can illustrate this relation status by `colouring' the edge, with a red edge
showing that the two know each other, and a blue edge showing that they haven't.
Hence, the situation described by the statement is shown by the following graph:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,0) -- (1,0);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,0) -- (1.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1.55,1) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,2) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,2) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (-0.55,1) -- (0,0);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,0) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1.55,1) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,0) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (0,0) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,0) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,0) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1.55,1) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,2) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (0,0) -- (1.55,1);

    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (1,2) circle (2pt);

This graph describes a situation in which we have two disjoint sets of 3 people
which mutually do not know each other, illustrated by the two blue triangle which
lie within the graph.

We can now ask a question which lies at the heart of Ramsey theory: Given positive
integers $s$ and $t$, can we always find a large enough group of people
such that $s$ mutually know each other, and $t$ do not? the answer
is yes, and I shall now define some notation: \cite{Graham1990}
$$[n] = \{1, 2,\ldots, n\}$$
$$[n]^k = \{Y:Y\subseteq [n], |Y|=k\}$$
$$[K]^k = \{Y:Y\subseteq K, |Y|=k\}$$

We say a graph is $complete$, and we denote a graph of order $n$ is \textit{complete}
if the set of edges is equal to $[n]^2$. We denote the complete graph $K_n$. Intuitively,]
a graph is complete if for every pair of vertices, there is an edge connecting them.

So in terms of complete graphs, $[n]$ represents the vertices and $[n]^2$ represents the
edges. We define an r-colouring of the edges of a graph (of order n) as a map \cite{Graham1990}:

$$\chi : [n]^2 \rightarrow [r]$$

We say a subgraph $K$ of $[n]^2$ is monochromatic if the restriction $\chi|_{[K]^2})$ is the constant map.

\begin{definition}[Clique]

    Given a complete graph $G$, $C$ is a clique of $G$ if 

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Ramsey's theorem for graphs]

    Given positive integers $s, t$, there exist a least positive integer $R(s,t)$ such that any r-colouring
    of $K_n, \hspace{1em} n\geq R(s,t)$, contains as a subgraph either a monochromatic $K_s$ or a monochromatic
    $K_t$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    We begin first by defining some more notation:
    \begin{definition}[Arrow-notation]
        We write $n\rightarrow (l_1,\ldots,l_r)$ if, for every r-colouring of $K_n$, there exists
        a monochromatic complete subgraph $K_{l_i}$, for some $i=1,...r$.\\

        Hence $R(s,t)$ is the least $n$ such that $n\rightarrow(s,t)$.

    \end{definition}

    The result we are proving here is the case $r=2$. Once we have proved this, we shall generalise the result
    to arbitrary $r$. We proceed by double induction on $s$ and $t$. Note that $R(s,2) = R(2,s)=s$, since a 2-colouring (say, red and blue)
    of $K_2$ either has a blue edge, or every other edge is red. This is illustrated in the graph below.\\

    Hence $R(s,2),R(2,s),R(t,2),R(2,t)$ all exist. We now assume, by induction, that $R(s,t-1)$ and $R(s-1,t)$ both exist.

    \textbf{Remark}: If $\chi$ is a 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, I will refer to the edges $\{ S \subseteq[n]^2 : \chi(S)=\{1\}\}$ as being `red',
        and the edges $\{ T \subseteq[n]^2 : \chi(T)=\{2\}\}$ as being `blue'.

    \begin{lemma}[$R(s,t)\leq R(s-1,t)+ R(s,t-1)$]\cite{Bollobas1998} 

    \end{lemma}
        
    \begin{proof}

        Let $n_1=R(s-1,t), n_2=R(s,t-1), n = n_1+n_2$, and consider a
        2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$. We need to show that we have
        either a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$. So let $x$ be any vertex of
        $K_n$. Since $x$ is joined by edges to $n-1=n_1+n_2-1$ other vertices,
        either there is at least $n_1$ red edges incident with $x$, or there
        are at least $n_2$ blue edges incident with $x$. We will assume that
        the first case holds, since the opposite result follows by symmetry.\\

        Consider a complete subgraph $K_{n_1}$ spanned by $n_1$ vertices
        joined to $x$ by red edges. If $K_{n_1}$ has a blue $K_t$, then we 
        are done. Otherwise, by the definition of $R(s-1,t)$, the graph
        $K_{n_1}$ contains a red $K_{s-1}$, which forms a red $K_s$ with $x$.

    \end{proof}

\end{proof}

This result is easily generalised to any finite r-colouring of $K_n$:

\begin{theorem}[General Case]

    Given $k$ positive integers $s_1, s_2,\ldots, s_k$, there exist a least
    positive integer $R_k(s_1,\ldots,s_k)$ such that any r-colouring of $K_n, \hspace{1em}
    n\geq R(s_1,\ldots,s_k)$, contains as a subgraph a monochromatic $K_{s_i}$,
    for some $i\in{1,\ldots k}$, coloured by the $i^{\text{th}}$ colour.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    We again proceed by induction on $k$. The base case for $R_2(s_1,s_2)$ is
    true by the previous theorem. So we assume by induction that
    $R_{k-1}(s_1,\ldots ,s_{k-1})$ exists. Then in any k-colouring of $K_n$ we 
    replace the first two colours by a new colour. If $n$ is sufficiently large,
    then either there is a $K_{s_1}$ coloured with the $i^{\text{th}}$ colour for
    some $i \in \{3,\ldots,k\}$, or else for $m=R(s_1,s_2)$ there is a $K_m$
    coloured with the new colour. I.e. in the original colouring this $K_m$ is 
    coloured with the first two original colours. In the first case we are done,
    and in the second, for $i=1$ or 2, we can find a monochromatic $K_{s_i}]]$ in
    $K_m$ coloured in $K_m$ coloured with the $i^{\text{th}}$ colour. Hence,
    $$R_k(s_1,\ldots,s_k)\leq R_{k-1}(R(s_1,s_2),s_3,\ldots,s_k)$$

\end{proof}

%We can generalise Ramsey's theorem one step further, this time to hypergraphs.
%
%\begin{definition}[Hypergraph]
%
%    Let $V = [n]$, $E=[n]^k$. A \textit(hypergraph) is an ordered pair $(V,E)$
%    such that $V\cap E = \varnothing $, and $E\subseteq \mathcal{P}(V)$, the power
%    set of $V$.
%
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{theorem}[Ramsey's theorem for Hypergraphs]
%
%\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Ramsey's theorem for Infinite Graphs]%\cite{lecturenotes}

\begin{definition}[Infinite graph]

    We can biject the set of infinitely many vertices with the natural numbers,
    denoted $\mathbb{N}$, and the set of edges between the vertices with the set
    of all unordered pairs of natural numbers, denoted $[\mathbb{N}]^2$.\\

    Then we define the infinite graph, $K_\infty$, as the ordered pair
    $K_\infty:=(\mathbb{N},[\mathbb{N}]^2)$.

\end{definition}

    When we r-colour the edges of the infinite graph $K_\infty$, there exists 
    within in an infinite monochromatic complete subgraph. I.e. $\exists
    X \subseteq K_\infty$ such that $X$ is infinite, and $\chi|_{[X]^2}$ is the
    constant function.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    Fix an arbitrary $a_1 \in \mathbb{N}$. Then by the pigeonhole principal, 
    there must exist an infinite set $\mathcal{B}_1\subseteq\mathbb{N}\setminus
    \{a_1\}$ such that all the $a_1-\mathcal{B}_1$ edges (i.e. edges of the form
    $(a_1,b_1)$ with $b_1\in\mathcal{B}_1$ are of the same colour.

\end{proof}
