\subsection{Ramsey's Theorem}
\label{sec:1.1}

The idea of finding regular substructure from chaotic structure is immediately
applicable to graphs.
The statement in the introduction - ``Given 6 people, either 3 mutually know each
other, or 3 do not" - can be rephrased in a graph theoretic sense.
We identify a person with a vertex of the graph, and a relation between them as
an edge.
A relation between two people can have  two states: either the two know each other,
or they have never met.
We can illustrate this relation status by `colouring' the edge, with a red edge
showing that the two know each other, and a blue edge showing that they haven't.
Hence, the situation described by the statement is shown by the following graph:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,0) -- (1,0);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,0) -- (1.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1.55,1) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,2) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,2) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (-0.55,1) -- (0,0);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (0,0) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1.55,1) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, blue] (1,0) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (0,0) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,0) -- (1,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,0) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1.55,1) -- (0,2);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (1,2) -- (-0.55,1);
    \draw[line width=2pt, red] (0,0) -- (1.55,1);

    \filldraw (0,0) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (1,0) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (1.55,1) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (1,2) circle (2pt);

This graph describes a situation in which we have two disjoint sets of 3 people
which mutually do not know each other, illustrated by the two blue triangle which
lie within the graph.

We can now ask a question which lies at the heart of Ramsey theory: Given positive
integers $s$ and $t$, can we always find a large enough group of people
such that $s$ mutually know each other, and $t$ do not? the answer
is yes, and I shall now define some notation:
$$[n] = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$$
$$[n]^2 = \{\{1, 1\}, \{1, 2\}, ..., \{n, n\}\}$$

We say a graph is $complete$, and we denote a graph of order $n$ is \textit{complete}
if the set of edges is equal to $[n]^2$. We denote the complete graph $K_n$. Intuitively,]
a graph is complete if for every pair of vertices, there is an edge connecting them.

So in terms of complete graphs, $[n]$ represents the vertices and $[n]^2$ represents the
edges. We define an r-colouring of the edges of a graph (of order n) as a map \cite{Graham1990}:

$$\chi : [n]^2 \rightarrow [r]$$

We say a subgraph $K$ of $[n]^2$ is monochromatic if the restriction $\chi|_K$ is the constant map.

\begin{definition}[Clique]

    Given a complete graph $G$, $C$ is a clique of $G$ if 

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Ramsey's theorem for graphs]

    Given positive integers $l_1$, there exist a least positive integer $R(s,t)$ such that any r-colouring
    of $K_n, \hspace{1em} n\geq R(s,t)$, contains as a subgraph either a monochromatic $K_s$ or a monochromatic
    $K_t$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    We begin first by defining some more notation:
    \begin{definition}[Arrow-notation]
        We write $n\rightarrow (l_1,...,l_r)$ if, for every r-colouring of $K_n$, there exists
        a monochromatic complete subgraph $K_{l_i}$, for some $i=1,...r$.\\

        Hence $R(s,t)$ is the least $n$ such that $n\rightarrow(s,t)$.

    \end{definition}

    The result we are proving here is the case $r=2$. Once we have proved this, we shall generalise the result
    to arbitrary $r$. We proceed by double induction on $s$ and $t$. Note that $R(s,2) = R(2,s)=s$, since a 2-colouring (say, red and blue)
    of $K_2$ either has a blue edge, or every other edge is red. This is illustrated in the graph below.\\

    Hence $R(s,2),R(2,s),R(t,2),R(2,t)$ all exist. We now assume, by induction, that $R(s,t-1)$ and $R(s-1,t)$ both exist.

    \textbf{Remark}: If $\chi$ is a 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, I will refer to the edges $\{ S \subseteq[n]^2 : \chi(S)=\{1\}\}$ as being `red',
        and the edges $\{ T \subseteq[n]^2 : \chi(T)=\{2\}\}$ as being `blue'.

    \begin{lemma}[$R(s,t)\leq R(s-1,t)+ R(s,t-1)$]\cite{Bollobas1998} 

    \end{lemma}
        
    \begin{proof}

        Let $n_1=R(s-1,t), n_2=R(s,t-1), n = n_1+n_2$, and consider a
        2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$. We need to show that we have
        either a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$. So let $x$ be any vertex of
        $K_n$. Since $x$ is joined by edges to $n-1=n_1+n_2-1$ other vertices,
        either there is at least $n_1$ red edges incident with $x$, or there
        are at least $n_2$ blue edges incident with $x$. We will assume that
        the first case holds, since the opposite result follows by symmetry.\\
        
        Consider a complete subgraph $K_{n_1}$ spanned by $n_1$ vertices
        joined to $x$ by red edges. If $K_{n_1}$ has a blue $K_t$, then we 
        are done. Otherwise, by the definition of $R(s-1,t)$, the graph
        $K_{n_1}$ contains a red $K_{s-1}$, which forms a red $K_s$ with x.

    \end{proof}
