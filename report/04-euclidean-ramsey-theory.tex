\subsection{Rado's Theorem}
\label{sec:4.1}

n this section we are going to show how a theorem from Rado generalising results
 from arithmetical Ramsey theory is the key to proving an interesting connection
  between combinatorial and algebraic properties of finite subsets of the 
  Euclidean space.

Here we denote, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $$[n]:=\{1,\cdots,n\}$$

The following results are commonly seen as precursors of Ramsey theory: Hilbert's 
cube Lemma (1892), Schur's Theorem (1916) and van der Waerden's Theorem (1927). 
\cite{Schacht2011}. 
They are all usually classified as arithmetical results, as they deal with 
combinatorial properties of $\mathbb{N}$.\\

A student of Schur's, Rado, generalised these results in 1933 (Schacht2014). 
In fact they can all be seen as statements abot monochromatic solutions to 
systems of linear homogeneous equations, in the sense that will be specified now.

\begin{definition}[Colouring of a set]
Let $X$ be a non-empty set. For $k\in\mathbb{N}$, a $k$-colouring of $X$ is a 
partition of $X$ into $k$ equivalence classes. 
\end{definition}

Equivalently, a $k$-colouring of $X$ is the partition of $X$ induced by an 
arbitrary map: $$\chi: X \to [k]$$ through the equivalence relation: 
$$\mathcal{R}_{\chi}:= \{(x_{1},x_{2})\in X | \chi(x)=\chi(y) \}$$
and $\chi$ is called the colouring function. Somewhat improperly, 
we will identify a $k$-colouring of $X$ with its colouring function.

\begin{definition}[Monochromatic vectors]
Let $X$ be non-empty and let $\chi$ be a $k$-colouring of $X$ for some 
$k\in\mathbb{N}$. Then an element $x = (x_{1},\cdots,x_{n})\in X^n$ is 
monochromatic if: 
$$\exists p \in [k] : \chi\bigg(\{x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\}\bigg) = \{p\}$$
\end{definition}

In the following, we will be studying systems of linear equations with rational 
coefficients. These will be denoted $\mathcal{L }=\mathcal{L}(x_{1},\cdots,x_{n})$. 
We are interested in monochromatic solutions $x\in \mathbb{N}^n$ to $\mathcal{L}$. 
We can formulate our problem in the following way:

\begin{definition}[Partition Regular matrices]
Let $\Lambda\in\mathbb{Q}^{n\times m}$. $\Lambda$ is $k$-regular over 
$\mathbb{N}$ if, under any $k$-colouring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a 
monochromatic $x\in\mathbb{N}^n$ such that $\Lambda x  = 0$.
$\Lambda$ is Partition Regular (PR) over $\mathbb{N}$ if $\Lambda$ is 
$k$-regular over $\mathbb{N}$ for all $k$.
\end{definition}

It is easy to see that $\Lambda$ is PR if and only if $\mu\Lambda$ is PR for all 
$\mu\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus{\{0\}}$. Hence our statements about PR matrices can 
be formulated, without loss of generality, for matrices with integer entries.
% Notice also that partition regularity over $\mathbb{N}$ implies partition regularity over $\mathbb{Z}$, as any finite colouring of $\mathbb{Z}$ induces a finite colouring of $\mathbb{N}$.

We are interested in PR matrices as they allow us to frame and formulate problems 
of elementary arithmetical Ramsey theory in an enlightening and compact way. 
For example, Schur's theorem states that the matrix 
$\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}$ is PR.
This turns out to be particularly useful since Rado's theorem establishes an 
equivalence between partition regularity and another, more algebraic property 
sof matrices:

\begin{definition}[Columns Property]
A matrix $\Lambda = \begin{pmatrix}
g_{1} & \cdots & g_{n} 
\end{pmatrix}\in \mathbb{Q}^{m\times n}$ satisfies the Columns Property (CP) 
if $[n]$ can be partitioned into a family of sets 
$$\bigg\{\Gamma_{1},\cdots,\Gamma_{r}\bigg\}$$ such that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sum\limits_{j\in\Gamma_{1}}g_{j} = 0$
\item $\forall i \in [r]\setminus\{1\}$, $\sum\limits_{ j \in {\Gamma_{i}}}g_{j} 
\in span\bigg\{g_{j} \ \bigg| \ j\in\bigcup\limits_{k \in [r]: k < i }\Gamma_{k}\bigg\}$
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

Rado's theorem states:

\begin{theorem}[Rado, 1933]
Let $\Lambda\in\mathbb{Q}^{m\times n}$. Then $\Lambda$ is partition regular if 
and only if it satisfies the columns property.
\end{theorem}

To prove Rado's theorem we use the following lemmas, the first of which "descends" 
almost immediately by an application of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization:

\begin{lemma}
Let $\{v_{1},\cdots,v_{n},v\}\in \mathbb{Z}^m$. If $v \not\in span\{v_{1},\cdots,v_{n}\}$, 
then there exists $u\in\mathbb{Z}^m$ such that: $u.v\not = 0$ and $\forall i\in [n], u.v_{i}=0$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{definition}[(m,p,c)-sets]
Let $m,p,c \in \mathbb{N}$. Then we define:
$$N_{m,p,c}:=\bigg\{\mu = (\mu_{1},\cdots,\mu_{m+1}) \  \bigg|  \ \exists j 
\in [m]: \forall i<j, \ \mu_{i}= 0 \ \emph{and} \ \mu_{j}=c \ \emph{and}  
\ \forall i>j, \ |\mu_{i}|\leq p\bigg\} $$
and for a given generator $y\in \mathbb{N}^{m+1}$ the (m,p,c)-set is defined as:
$$S_{m,p,c}(y):=\bigg\{y.\mu \ | \mu\in N_{m,p,c}\bigg\}$$
\end{definition}



\begin{lemma}
Let $m,p,c \in \mathbb{N}$. For any finite colouring of $\mathbb{N}$, 
there exists $y\in \mathbb{N}^{m+1}$ such that $S_{m,p,c}(y)$ is monochromatic.
\end{lemma}


This is proved through application of van der Waerden.


We now sketch a proof of Rado's theorem:


\textit{Sketch of proof}.(Rado)(Liu2016)
We work with $\Lambda\in\mathbb{Z}^{m\times n}$ without loss of generality.\\
For the necessary implication, we choose the following colouring: for an arbitrary 
prime $p$, let $\chi_{p}:\mathbb{N}\to[p-1]$ such that, if $y\in\mathbb{N}$ is 
written in basis $p$, its colour is the least non-zero coefficient $d(y)$. 
Call $\pi(y)$ its position in the expansion. Since $\Lambda$ is PR, there exists 
a monochromatic solution $x = (x_{1},\cdots,x_{n})\in \mathbb{N}^n$ such that 
$\Lambda x = 0$. Now order the natural numbers $x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}$ in an 
increasing fashion by position $\pi(x_{j})$ of the first non-zero coefficient 
$d(x_{j})$ in their $p$-expansion. Partition their indices into sets 
$\Gamma_{i}:=\{j\in [n] \ | \ \pi(x_{j})=i\}$. Then by means of properties of 
primes integers and our first Lemma one shows that such a partition satisfies 
the Columns Property conditions.
For the sufficient implication, we show that there exist $m,p,c\in\mathbb{N}$ 
such that for all $x\in\mathbb{N}$, $S_{m,p,c}(x)$ contains a solution to our 
system of equations. This is done constructively, using the Columns Property 
that we assume. Then, by our second Lemma, one such solution must be monochromatic. Ã¹

\subsection{Euclidean Ramsey theory}
\label{sec:4.2}

What makes Rado's theorem beautiful is its ability to translate a combinatorial 
property of the positive integers into an algebraic property of matrices. 
That is, it enables us to solve general problems of the Hilbert-Schur-van 
der Waerden kind, through a unified algebraic approach.

In this section we will see how a generalization of Rado's theorem 
(Erd\H os 1973) enables us to translate a combinatorial property of 
finite subsets of the Euclidean space into a geometric property of the points 
of such set.

We first define a notion of Ramseyness for finite sets $F\in\mathbb{R}^n$. 

\begin{definition}[Configurations]
A figure is a finite set $F\in \mathbb{R}^m$.
% for some $m\in \mathbb{N}$ such that the elements of K are subject to purely 
%metrical costraints.
Consider the set of all figures 
$$\mathfrak{F}:= \{F \ | \ \exists n \in \mathbb{N} : F \  
\textit{is finite in} \ \mathbb{R}^n\} $$ 
This is clearly non-empty as $\{0\}\subset\mathbb{R}$ is in $\mathfrak{F}$.
Define an equivalence relation as follows: $$F \sim F' 
\iff \ \textit{there exists an isometry} \ \Psi \textit{such that} 
\ \Psi(F)=F'$$
Then we define the set of Euclidean configurations 
$$\mathfrak{K}:=\frac{\mathfrak{F}}{\sim}$$
An element $K=[F]$ of $\mathfrak{K}$ is called a configuration.
If $F$ and $F'$ are figures with $[F]=[F']$, we say that they have the same 
configuration.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Ramsey property]
A configuration $K$ is Ramsey if: 
\begin{center}
$\forall r\in\mathbb{N}$, $\exists n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, 
under any $r$-colouring of $\mathbb{R}^n$,  there exists a monochromatic 
$F\in K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
\end{center}
\end{definition}

A natural question to consider is whether there exists any class of 
configurations that are not Ramsey. Consider the following geometrical 
property of a figure:

\begin{definition}[Spherical figures]
A figure $F\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is spherical if there exists a sphere 
$S\in\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $F\subset S$.
\end{definition}

It is easy to see that if a figure $F$ is spherical, then any figure with 
the same configuration will be spherical. In fact isometries preserve spheres. 
Hence it makes sense to talk about spherical configurations.

Our aim in this section is to prove the following

\begin{theorem}[Erd\H os,1973]
If $K$ is Ramsey, $K$ is spherical.
\end{theorem}

Our main tool is the following Lemma, which is a generalization of Rado's theorem:

\begin{lemma}[Erd\H os,1973]
Let $c_{1},\cdots,c_{k}$ and $b\neq 0$ be elements of $\mathbb{R}$. Then there 
exists a colouring $\chi$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that the equation: 
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{k} c_{i}(x_{i} - x_{0}) = b $$ has no monochromatic solution.
\end{lemma}

\textit{Proof}. It suffices to prove the statement for $\mathbb{Q}$ and then for 
transcendental extensions. (...)

We will also use the following characterisation of a spherical figure:

\begin{lemma}
A figure $F = \{v_{0},\cdots,v_{k}\}$ is not spherical if and only if there 
exist scalars $\{0\}\neq\{\mu_{1},\cdots, \mu_{k}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sum_{i=1}^{i=k} \mu_{i} (v_{i} - v_{0})= 0$;
\item $\sum_{i=1}^{i=k} \mu_{i} (|v_{i}|^2 - |v_{0}|^2) = b \neq 0 $
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\textit{Proof}. (...)

Notice that if $F$ is not spherical, then any other figure with the same 
configuration is not spherical. In particular, if $E$ has the same configuration 
as $F$, the elements of $E$ satisfy our last Lemma for the same choice of scalar 
coefficients $\{\mu_{1},\cdots, \mu_{k}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$, as the equations (1) 
and (2) are invariant under isometry.

\textit{Proof of Erd\H os}. Let $F$ be a non-spherical figure. Then there exist 
coefficients $\{\mu_{1},\cdots, \mu_{k}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that equations 
(1) and (2) from our first Lemma are satisfied. By our second Lemma there exists 
an $r$-colouring $\chi$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that (2) has no monochromatic 
solution. We define the following colouring of 
$\mathbb{R}^n$: $$\chi^*: \mathbb{R}^n\to [r] : v \mapsto \chi(|v|^2) $$
Then it is easy to see that if there exists a monochromatic 
$E\in [F]$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then there exists a monochromatic solution to (2), 
since the elements of $E$ satisfy (2) with the same choice of coefficients by a 
previous observation. But this contradicts our first Lemma. \qed
