$\langle $ write the opening paragraph$ \rangle$

This report presents an overview of Ramsey theory in four parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A graph theoretic description of the initial Ramsey theorems and some
  of their extensions;
\item A look at Euclidean Ramsey theory, an application of the results to structures
  in $\R^n$;
\item The Hales-Jewett theorem, a result in Ramsey theory that has implications in
  combinatorics and group theory;
\item An example of structural Ramsey theory, which extends results from Ramsey
  theory to algebraic objects which have additional structure
\end{itemize}

We first present a result that highlights the nature of Ramsey theory, the
Szemerédi Regularity Lemma, but which is actually a result in extremal graph theory.
This is done as it allows for some definitions and propositions needed
for the later sections to be introduced now.
It is easiest to state in graph theoretic terms, yet it will be shown that the
lemma has applications to the existence of arithmetic progressions in integer
subsets via Szemerédi's Theorem.

$\langle $write and prove the lemma, explain the theorem, add definitions$ \rangle$
