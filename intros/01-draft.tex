This report presents an overview of Ramsey theory in four parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A graph theoretic description of the initial Ramsey theorems and some
  of their extensions;
\item A look at Euclidean Ramsey theory, an application of the results to structures
  in $\R^n$;
\item The Hales-Jewett theorem, a result in Ramsey theory that has implications in
  combinatorics and group theory;
\item An example of structural Ramsey theory, which extends results from Ramsey
  theory to algebraic objects which have additional structure
\end{itemize}
