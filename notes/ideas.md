## Random Graphs

Random graph theory is concerned with what kind of sub-structures random graphs
have.
Bollob√°s names three models of random graph:

+ $G(n,M)$: Take every colouring of $K_n$ that colours $M$ edges red and the rest
blue.
Assign each colouring an equal probability and look at the result as a probability
space.
+ $G(n,p)$: Take $K_n$ and assign each edge a probability of being coloured red
of $p$, $1-p$ blue.
+ Look at a sequence of graphs, each adding a random edge to the one prior.
Consider this as a random process.

## Groups as Graphs

Can represent a group by a coloured directed graph (called a Cayley graph).
We were thinking that we could use Ramsey theory to find the smallest order of a
group such that there exist certain subgroups.

Ramsey's theorem  gives the size that graph needs to be in order for us to get
regular subgraphs (e.g. complete subgraphs).
