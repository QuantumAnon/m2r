## Random Graphs

Random graph theory is concerned with what kind of sub-structures random graphs have.
Bollob√°s names three models of random graph:

+ $G(n,M)$: Take every colouring of $K_n$ that colours $M$ edges red and the rest
blue.
Assign each colouring an equal probability and look at the result as a probability
space.
+ $G(n,p)$: Take $K_n$ and assign each edge a probability of being coloured red
of $p$, $1-p$ blue.
+ Look at a sequence of graphs, each adding a random edge to the one prior.
Consider this as a random process.
