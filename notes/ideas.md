## Random Graphs

## Groups as Graphs

Can represent a group by a coloured directed graph (called a Cayley graph). We were thinking that we could use Ramsey theory to find the smallest order of a group such that there exist certain subgroups.

Ramsey's theorem  gives the size that graph needs to be in order for us to get regular subgraphs (e.g. complete subgraphs).
